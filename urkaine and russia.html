    <h1>the border issue</h1>
    <p1>What was Putin's goal?
        The Russian leader's initial aim was to overrun Ukraine and depose its government, ending for good its desire to
        join the Western defensive alliance Nato. But he failed to capture the capital Kyiv and has now shifted his
        ambitions to Ukraine's east and south.Launching the invasion on 24 February he told the Russian people his goal
        was to "demilitarise and de-Nazify
        Ukraine", to protect people subjected to what he called eight years of bullying and genocide by Ukraine's
        government. "It is not our plan to occupy the Ukrainian territory. We do not intend to impose anything on anyone
        by force," he insisted. This was not even a war or invasion, he claimed, merely the fiction of a "special
        military operation" that
        Russian state-controlled media are required to adopt. <b>The claims of Nazis and genocide in Ukraine were
            completely unfounded, but it was clear Russia saw this as a
            pivotal moment. "Russia's future and its future place in the world are at stake," said foreign intelligence
            chief Sergei Naryshkin.Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke of freeing</b><i> Ukraine from oppression, while
            Ukraine's democratically elected
            President Volodymyr Zelensky said "the enemy has designated me as target number one</i>; my family is target
        number two". Russia invaded from the north, through Belarus, as well as from the south and east, but Ukraine's
        fierce
        resistance has caused heavy losses and forced the Kremlin to drop its plan to oust the government</p1>
